DEBUGGING SUMMARY - Step by Step Verification
======================================================================

STEP 1: Sources (Currents & Magnets) ✅
  - Magnetization: 9.549e+05 A/m (✅ Good)
  - Currents: 3.797e+06 A/m² (✅ Good)
  - Sources are properly initialized

STEP 2: RHS Assembly ⚠️
  - ||RHS|| = 1.57e+04 (✅ Non-zero)
  - PROBLEM: 100% of RHS is in boundary DOFs
  - This is expected for Nédélec elements (volume integrals → edge DOFs)

STEP 3: Boundary Conditions ⚠️
  - ||RHS|| before BCs: 1.57e+04
  - ||RHS|| after BCs: 1.44e+01
  - 99.9% of RHS is lost when applying zero BCs
  - This causes A field to be essentially zero

ROOT CAUSE:
  For Nédélec (H(curl)) elements, volume integrals contribute to edge DOFs.
  If edges are on the boundary, all contributions go to boundary DOFs.
  When we apply zero BCs (petsc.set_bc), we zero out boundary DOFs,
  losing all RHS contributions.

SOLUTION OPTIONS:
  1. Redistribute boundary contributions to interior DOFs before applying BCs
  2. Use lifting to handle boundary conditions properly
  3. Modify BC application to preserve RHS contributions
  4. Use a different approach for zero BCs with Nédélec elements

NEXT STEPS:
  1. Fix RHS assembly to handle boundary DOFs correctly
  2. Test that RHS after BCs is non-zero
  3. Verify solve produces non-zero A field
  4. Check XDMF file is correct for ParaView
