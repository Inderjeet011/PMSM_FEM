BOUNDARY CONDITION TEST RESULTS - V REFERENCE VALUE ANALYSIS
A Story of Discovery
================================================================================

THE PROBLEM
-----------

We are solving Maxwell's equations for an electric motor using a mixed 
A-V formulation. This means we solve for two unknowns:
- Az: The magnetic vector potential (which gives us the magnetic field B)
- V:  The electric scalar potential

The challenge: In our equations, V only appears as grad(V), not V itself. 
This means mathematically, adding any constant to V shouldn't change the 
magnetic field B. But we still need to set V somewhere to make the problem 
solvable - otherwise the system is underdetermined.

THE QUESTION
------------

We wondered: "If we change the value of V on the boundary (say from 0 to 4 
or even 5000), will the magnetic field B change? Or will it stay the same 
since only grad(V) matters?"

THE EXPERIMENTS
---------------

EXPERIMENT 1: Testing on the Rotor Patch
----------------------------------------

First, we set V = 0 on a small patch of the rotor (the rotating part of the 
motor). We ran the simulation and got:
  B_rms (domain):  1.157 T
  B_rms (air-gap): 0.911 T

Then we changed V to 4.0 V on the same rotor patch:
  B_rms (domain):  0.825 T
  B_rms (air-gap): 0.650 T

Surprise! The results were different. But wait - maybe V = 0 is special? 
Let's test with a really large value: V = 5000 V:
  B_rms (domain):  0.825 T
  B_rms (air-gap): 0.650 T

Interesting! V = 4 and V = 5000 give EXACTLY the same B values! But V = 0 
gave different results. This suggests that V = 0 might be handled differently 
by the numerical solver.

EXPERIMENT 2: Testing on the Exterior Boundary
-----------------------------------------------

Someone suggested: "What if we set V on the outside boundary of the motor 
instead of on the rotor? That would still give us a reference point."

So we moved the boundary condition to the exterior boundary and tested again:

With V = 0 on the exterior:
  B_rms (domain):  1.754 T
  B_rms (air-gap): 1.381 T

With V = 4 on the exterior:
  B_rms (domain):  0.825 T
  B_rms (air-gap): 0.650 T

With V = 1000 on the exterior:
  B_rms (domain):  0.825 T
  B_rms (air-gap): 0.650 T

Again, V = 4 and V = 1000 give IDENTICAL results, but V = 0 is different!

WHAT WE LEARNED
---------------

1. The absolute value of V doesn't matter (when it's not zero)
   - Whether we use V = 4, V = 1000, or V = 5000, we get the same B field
   - This confirms our theory: only grad(V) matters, not the absolute value

2. V = 0 behaves strangely
   - Setting V = 0 gives different results than any non-zero value
   - This is likely because numerical solvers handle zero boundary conditions 
     differently (maybe as "uninitialized" or with special treatment)

3. Where we set V matters
   - Setting V on the rotor patch vs. the exterior boundary gives different 
     B values (because it changes how the constraint propagates through the 
     domain)
   - But once we choose a location, the absolute value (if non-zero) doesn't 
     matter

4. We need the boundary condition
   - Without setting V somewhere, the problem is not uniquely solvable
   - It's like having a floating voltage - we need to "ground" it somewhere

THE TAKEAWAY
------------

For practical simulations:
- You MUST set V somewhere to make the problem solvable
- Choose the location based on physics (e.g., rotor patch if rotor is 
  grounded, or exterior if outer boundary is grounded)
- Use a non-zero value (like V = 4 or V = 1000) instead of exactly zero 
  to avoid numerical issues
- The exact value doesn't matter - 4, 1000, or 5000 all give the same 
  magnetic field B

This confirms that our mathematical understanding is correct: the magnetic 
field B depends only on grad(V), not on the absolute value of V.

SUMMARY OF NUMERICAL RESULTS
================================================================================

ROTOR PATCH TESTS:
  V = 0.0 V    →  B_rms = 1.157 T (domain), 0.911 T (air-gap)
  V = 4.0 V    →  B_rms = 0.825 T (domain), 0.650 T (air-gap)
  V = 5000.0 V →  B_rms = 0.825 T (domain), 0.650 T (air-gap)

EXTERIOR BOUNDARY TESTS:
  V = 0.0 V    →  B_rms = 1.754 T (domain), 1.381 T (air-gap)
  V = 4.0 V    →  B_rms = 0.825 T (domain), 0.650 T (air-gap)
  V = 1000.0 V →  B_rms = 0.825 T (domain), 0.650 T (air-gap)
