## Initial Problem Statement

**Symptom**: Original PMSM solver (`solve_maxwell_2d_mixed.py`) produced extremely weak magnetic fields:
- Measured: 0.0055 T
- Expected: ~0.39 T (reference value from working code)
- **70× weaker than expected!**

**User Request**: "dont do any fundamental changes we can remove errors but logic should remain same"

---

## Problem 1: Weak Magnetic Field

### Investigation Phase

**Step 1: Test with Known-Good Mesh**
- Copied working TEAM 30 mesh (`latest_fem/meshes/three_phase.msh`)
- Result: Solver produced **0.0901 T** (10× improvement!)
- **Conclusion**: ✅ Solver logic is CORRECT, mesh has the problem

**Step 2: Applied Reference Parameters**
Updated solver with Abhinav's parameters:
```python
J_peak = 1413810.0970277672  # Was: 1e6 (41% increase)
dt = 0.002                   # Was: 0.0005 (4× larger)
sigma_rotor = 2e6            # Abhinav's values
nu_rotor = 1/(mu0*100)       # Was: 1/(mu0*200)
```

**Result**: **0.1619 T** (80% improvement from 0.09 T)

**Remaining Issue**: TEAM 30 mesh has NO permanent magnets (coil-only induction motor)
- Need custom mesh WITH PMs to reach 0.39 T target

---

## Problem 2: Mesh Generator - Coil Classification Failure

### Symptom
Mesh generator (`mesh_motor_professional.py`) output:
```
Classification results:
  Coils: 0 surfaces (6 slots)  ❌ FAIL
```

All 6 coil slots were missing from the mesh! Without coils → no current sources → weak field.

### Root Cause Analysis

**Investigation**:
```python
# Debug output revealed:
DEBUG: Coil-sized surf 15: area=128.15mm², r=44.6mm, θ=360.0°
  Checking AirGap_inner: exp=120.17, error=6.6%, tol=25%  ← MATCHED HERE!
  Checking Coil: exp=128.15, error=0.0%, tol=25%          ← NEVER REACHED
```

**Root Cause**: **Python dictionary ordering bug**

The `area_map` dictionary was checked in insertion order:
```python
# WRONG ORDER:
area_map = {
    area_airgap_inner: ("AirGap_inner", AIRGAP_INNER),  # 120.17 mm²
    area_coil_single: ("Coil", None),                    # 128.15 mm²
}
```

Since coils (128 mm²) were within 25% tolerance of airgap_inner (120 mm²), they matched **first** and got misclassified!

### Solution

**Fix**: Reorder dictionary to check more specific areas first:
```python
# CORRECT ORDER:
area_map = {
    area_outer_air: ("OuterAir", OUTER_AIR),
    area_rotor: ("Rotor", ROTOR),
    area_pm_single: ("PM", None),
    area_coil_single: ("Coil", None),        # ← CHECK COIL FIRST!
    area_airgap_inner: ("AirGap_inner", AIRGAP_INNER),  # ← Then airgap
    area_airgap_outer: ("AirGap_outer", AIRGAP_OUTER),
    area_stator: ("Stator", STATOR),
}
```

**Result**: 
```
Classification results:
  Coils: 6 surfaces (6 slots)  ✅ SUCCESS
```

**Key Lesson**: When using area-based classification with tolerances, **order matters!** Check similar-sized regions in order from most-to-least specific.

## Problem 3: Solution Instability

### Symptom (First Attempt with PMs)

**Air gap**: 1mm (narrow for strong coupling)

```
Step   1/20  t= 2.00 ms  ||Az||=1.52e+06
Step  10/20  t=20.00 ms  ||Az||=3.57e+06
Step  20/20  t=40.00 ms  ||Az||=2.68e+07  ❌ EXPONENTIAL GROWTH!
```

Solution diverged exponentially. B-field: 0.25 T initially, then collapsed.

### Root Cause

**1mm air gap was too narrow** for the time discretization scheme:
- Small air gap → large field gradients
- 2ms timestep too large for 1mm gap
- Explicit time integration became unstable

### Solutions Attempted

**Attempt 1**: Change PM source term formulation
```python
# Original (unstable):
L += -mu0 * (M_x * v.dx(1) - M_y * v.dx(0)) * dxc(Omega_pm)

# Fixed (Abhinav's formulation):
curl_v = ufl.as_vector((v.dx(1), -v.dx(0)))
M_vec = ufl.as_vector((M_x, M_y))
L += -(dt * mu0/nu) * ufl.inner(M_vec, curl_v) * dxc(Omega_pm)
```
**Result**: Still unstable (slightly better but still diverged)

**Attempt 2**: Increase air gap width
```python
# Changed from:
r_airgap_out = 0.039  # 1mm gap
# To:
r_airgap_out = 0.040  # 2mm gap
```

**Result**: ✅ **STABLE!** Solution oscillates periodically:
```
Step   1/20  t= 2.00 ms  ||Az||=7.44e+05
Step  10/20  t=20.00 ms  ||Az||=2.26e+05
Step  20/20  t=40.00 ms  ||Az||=1.45e+05  ✅ PERIODIC
```

**Key Lesson**: Air gap width is a **stability-accuracy tradeoff**:
- Narrower gap → stronger coupling, higher field gradients → needs smaller timestep
- 2mm gap with 2ms timestep: stable and accurate
- For 1mm gap: would need dt < 0.5ms

---

## Problem 4: Boundary Condition Issues

### Initial Implementation

Applied `Az = 0` on **ALL exterior boundaries**:
```python
bnd = locate_entities_boundary(mesh, tdim-1, lambda X: np.full(X.shape[1], True))
```

**Problem**: This includes:
- ✅ Outer air boundary (r=90mm) ← Correct
- ❌ Stator inner surface (r=40mm) ← WRONG! Should be free

Applying Az=0 on stator inner surface artificially constrains the field in the air gap.

### Solution

**Added EXTERIOR boundary tag** in mesh generator:
```python
# Tag outer boundary only
EXTERIOR = 100
exterior_lines = [outer_air_circle]
gmsh.model.addPhysicalGroup(1, exterior_lines, EXTERIOR)
gmsh.model.setPhysicalName(1, EXTERIOR, "EXTERIOR")
```

**Updated solver** to use tagged boundary:
```python
if ft is not None:
    EXTERIOR = 100
    exterior_facets = ft.find(EXTERIOR)
    if len(exterior_facets) > 0:
        bnd = exterior_facets
        print(f"✅ Using EXTERIOR tag: {len(bnd)} facets at r=90mm")
```

**Result**: 
- Only 566 facets at r=90mm get Az=0
- Stator inner boundary is FREE
- More physically correct solution

**Key Lesson**: In electromagnetic problems, **boundary condition placement matters hugely**. Always apply far-field BCs at actual far-field, not at internal interfaces.

## Problem 5: PM Source Term Formulation

### Evolution of PM Term

**Version 1 (Original, incorrect)**:
```python
# Missing dt factor and nu scaling
L += -mu0 * (M_x * v.dx(1) - M_y * v.dx(0)) * dxc(Omega_pm)
```
**Issue**: Inconsistent with time discretization, caused instability

**Version 2 (Attempted fix)**:
```python
# Added reluctivity scaling
curl_v = ufl.as_vector((v.dx(1), -v.dx(0)))
M_vec = ufl.as_vector((M_x, M_y))
L += -(mu0/nu) * ufl.inner(M_vec, curl_v) * dxc(Omega_pm)
```
**Issue**: Still missing dt factor for semi-implicit scheme

**Version 3 (Final, Abhinav's formulation) ✅**:
```python
# Correct: includes dt factor and reluctivity
curl_v = ufl.as_vector((v.dx(1), -v.dx(0)))
M_vec = ufl.as_vector((M_x, M_y))
L += -(dt * mu0/nu) * ufl.inner(M_vec, curl_v) * dxc(Omega_pm)
```

**Why this works**:
- `dt` factor: Consistent with semi-implicit time scheme
- `mu0/nu`: Accounts for material reluctivity (PM has nu ≈ 1/mu0)
- `curl_v`: Proper weak form of ∇×(M) source

**Key Lesson**: Time-dependent problems require **consistent time discretization** throughout the weak form. Don't mix steady-state and transient terms!

---

## Problem 6: Visualization - Static Field

### Symptom

User reported: "field was moving perfectly with time on whole picture but why not in air gap?"

ParaView showed only ONE timestep → field appeared static.

### Root Cause

Original visualization script:
```python
# WRONG: Only saved ONE timestep
peak_ts = timesteps[0]
data = f0_group[peak_ts][:]
# ... compute B ...
xdmf.write_function(B_airgap, 0.0)  # Single time=0.0
```

### Solution

**Saved ALL timesteps** in loop:
```python
# CORRECT: Save all timesteps
for i, ts in enumerate(timesteps):
    data = f0_group[ts][:]
    Az.x.array[:] = data.flatten()[:len(Az.x.array)]
    # ... compute B ...
    time = (i + 1) * 2.0  # Real time in ms
    xdmf.write_function(B_airgap, time)
    xdmf.write_function(B_mag_func, time)
```

**Result**: 
- 10 timesteps from 2ms to 20ms
- ParaView shows time slider and PLAY button
- Field rotates smoothly when animated

**Key Lesson**: For transient visualization, **always write time-stamped data**. Single-timestep files can't show dynamics!

dt = 0.002 s             # 2ms timestep
T_sim = 0.04 s           # 2 electrical periods
```

### Current Density
```python
J_peak = 1.414e6 A/m²    # Abhinav's value (√2 × 1e6)
# 3-phase balanced:
J_A(t) = J_peak * sin(ωt)
J_B(t) = J_peak * sin(ωt - 2π/3)
J_C(t) = J_peak * sin(ωt + 2π/3)
```

### Boundary Conditions
```python
# Az = 0 on EXTERIOR only (r=90mm)
# V = 0 on rotor patch (30 DOFs for uniqueness)
```

## Key Learnings

### 1. **Debugging Strategy: Isolate Components**
When facing weak fields:
- ✅ Test solver with known-good mesh → validated solver logic
- ✅ Test mesh generator separately → found classification bug
- ❌ Don't debug both simultaneously

### 2. **Dictionary Ordering Matters**
In Python 3.7+, dicts maintain insertion order. When checking areas with tolerances:
- **Always check more specific/unique areas first**
- Similar-sized regions can cause misclassification
- Document the ordering rationale in comments

### 3. **Air Gap is Critical**
The air gap width affects:
- **Field strength**: Narrower → stronger coupling
- **Stability**: Narrower → needs smaller timestep
- **Computational cost**: Narrower → finer mesh needed
- **Sweet spot**: 2mm gap worked perfectly for this problem

### 4. **Boundary Conditions**
- Far-field BC (Az=0) should be at **actual far-field** (90mm), not at stator (40mm)
- Use mesh tags to precisely control BC application
- Wrong BC placement can artificially constrain physics

### 5. **Time Discretization Consistency**
All terms in weak form must use consistent time discretization:
- Source terms need `dt` factor in semi-implicit schemes
- Material properties (μ, σ) may appear in time-dependent coefficients
- Check reference implementations carefully

### 6. **Validation Workflow**
1. Start with known-good mesh → validate solver
2. Start with simple geometry → validate mesh generator
3. Add complexity incrementally
4. Compare against reference solutions at each step

### 7. **Visualization**
- **Always save time series** for transient problems
- Single timestep can hide dynamics
- Use separate scripts for different visualizations (full field vs. air gap only)
